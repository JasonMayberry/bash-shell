Remember to start the MySQL server:
$ service mysql start

 $ mysql   -u  root   -p
 Enter Password:

   Note: Default user name and password is root
         **************************************

You can enter a database from the command line like this:
 $ mysql -u root -p database_name

   Enter your password, then you can run your mysql commands.

   Another way is to use:

 mysql -u root -p database_name << eof
 DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = "attachment"
 eof

   Or try this:

 mysql --host *HOST_IP* --user *USER* --password=*PASSWORD* -D *DATABASE_NAME* -e "DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = "attachment" ;

   Using the MySQL CLI client.

 $ mysql -u <user> -p
 mysql> use <your-database>
 mysql> DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = "attachment"

   Notice that I'm using -u and username, but in -p I'm not setting anything. MySQL will ask you for your password.

   And if you're trying to use it inline, you can use

 $ mysql -u <user> -p <your-database> -e "DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = 'attachment'"

   Here, notice that I'm using also -e argument. It stands for execute.




How to list MySQL database table column names without the table formatting
                                              ****************************
First, start MySQL with the -sN options, like this:

+--------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Option | Long Option         | Description                             |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| -s     | --silent            | Be more silent. Print results with a    |
|        |                     | tab as separator, each row on new line. |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| -N     | --skip-column-names | Don't write column names in results.    |

   Pro tip

   In MySQL client you can use:

 mysql> show databases;

   if you want to view all dabatases in your server. And you can use:

 mysql> use <database>;
 mysql> show tables;

   if you want to view all tables into a database.

   I'm using $ and mysql> as prompts, $ means your Linux terminal, and mysql>, MySQL client.


   There is a series of steps to Execute MySQL in Linux Ubuntu Terminal.

    1. Execute MySQL Client using the following command: mysql -u root -p
    2. It is important to Create a New Database first using the command: create database demo_db;
    3. Then you have to Authorize the Database using the command: grant all on demo_db.* to ‘testuser’ identified by
       ‘12345’;
    4. Then Log in from the Database itself using the command: mysql -u testuser -p
    5. Then, you can actually start with the actual SQL Commands.

   I referred to the article http://www.codingalpha.com/run-mysql-database-linux-ubuntu/ where they have explained
   perfect steps to Execute MySQL in Linux Ubuntu! Hope I got your MySQL Running Perfectly.

       Please note that mysql is the client, and not the server. Before starting the client, check that the server is
       running by issuing sudo status mysql and if it is not running, start it with sudo start mysql. – Guss Dec 31 '15
